\begin{abstract}
This paper is the third in a series of tests of gravity using observations of 
stars and nearby
dwarf galaxies. We carry out four distinct tests using published data on the
kinematics
and morphology of dwarf galaxies, motivated by the theoretical work of
\citet{hui09} and \citet{bhuvjake2011}. In a wide class of
gravity theories a scalar field couples to matter and provides an attractive
fifth force. Stars and gas may respond differently to the scalar force leading to 
several observable deviations from standard gravity: 
HI gas, red giant stars and main sequence stars
can be displaced relative to each other and 
the stellar disk can display warps or asymmetric rotation curves aligned with
external potential gradients.  
To distinguish the effects of modified
gravity from standard astrophysical phenomena, we use a control sample of
galaxies that are expected to be screened from the fifth force.
In all cases we find no significant deviation
from the null hypothesis of general relativity. We have used a variety of
sources of data to carry out these tests. We discuss how 
improved tests can be perfomed with a more comprehensive analysis and
new observations of nearby galaxies in the optical and radio.

\section{Introduction}

%\jakesays{Much of this section is copied word-for-word from the intro
%  of \citet{bhuvjake2011}.  We need to address that.}
The true nature of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe remains a
mystery, but the possible solutions to this puzzle fall into two broad
categories. The first is to posit the existence of a new component of the
universe with an appropriate equation of state to cause the observed
acceleration. This ``dark energy'' may be due to an exotic particle or field, or
be related to the vacuum energy of space itself. A second approach is to seek to
explain this acceleration through modifications to the field equations of
general relativity (GR) itself. In recent years this modified gravity (MG)
approach has received attention and different approaches are being actively
developed -- for a review see e.g. \citet{jain-khoury10}. 
Even on theoretical grounds, modified theories of gravity are well
motivated: GR is unlikely to be the complete theory of gravity owing to 
singularities and its non-renormalizeability. Hence it is generally
considered to be the low energy effective action of some UV-complete
theory, though our interest is modifications in the long distance/low energy
regime. 
 
 A modification of GR on large (astrophysical) scales generically leads to
scalar-tensor theories of gravity, where a new scalar field couples to gravity.
Equivalently these theories can be described via a coupling of the scalar field
to matter, which leads to enhancements of the gravitational force.
Nonrelativistic matter -- such as the stars, gas, and dust in galaxies -- will
feel this enhanced force, which in general lead to larger dynamically inferred
masses. The discrepancy can be up to a factor of 1/3 in f(R) or DGP gravity. We
note that photons, being relativistic, do not feel the enhanced force, so that
lensing probes the true mass distribution.
 
This enhanced gravitational force should be detectable through fifth force 
experiments, tests of the equivalence principle (if the scalar coupling to
matter varied with the properties of matter) or through the orbits of planets
around the Sun \citep{will06}. \citet{khoury04} proposed that
nonlinear screening of the scalar field, called chameleon screening, can
suppress the fifth force in high density environments such as the Milky Way, so
that Solar System and lab tests can then be satisfied. This screening was
originally suggested to hide the effects of a quintessence-like scalar that
forms the dark energy and may couple to matter (generically such a coupling is
expected unless forbidden by a symmetry). Hence there are reasons to expect such
a screening effect to operate in either a dark energy or modified gravity
scenario. Indeed, since there are only a handful of screening mechanisms
(Vainshtein and symmetron screening are discussed below), small scale tests of
gravity that rely on distinct signatures of screening are useful discriminators
of cosmological models.
 
Dwarf galaxies in low-density environments may remain unscreened as the 
Newtonian potential, which determines the level of screening, is an order of
magnitude smaller in magnitude than in the Milky Way. Hence dwarf galaxies can
exhibit manifestations of modified forces in both their infall motions and
internal dynamics. \citet{hui09}, \\ \citet{bhuvjake2011}, \citet{changhui}, \citet{hui10}
and \cite{jainvinu2012}
discuss various observational effects. Indeed the small scale dynamics of 
nearby galaxies may have a bigger signal of MG than large-scale perturbations 
(see \citet{jain11}) for a discussion of observational approaches.
 
In this work, we discuss observable effects on disk galaxies that  arise due to 
their internal dynamics or their interaction with a neighbor or other sources of
an external gravitational field. We focus on late-type dwarf galaxies as these
are most likely to be unscreened. The observational effects are rooted in the
fact that under certain modified gravity theories, denser matter within
the dwarf galaxies will self-screen, and thus respond to a different
gravitational potential than the less dense, and therefore unscreened, matter.
So, for example, if the stellar component of a dwarf galaxy self-screens,
it will lag the dark matter and HI disk in the infall towards
another galaxy. This may lead to a separation of the stellar disk from the
center of mass of the dark matter and from the HI disk, and lead to
observable distortions of the morphology and/or dynamics of the stellar disk.

The origin of these effects, however, 
may be difficult to disentangle from other astrophysical
processes. To address this, we can create a control sample of screened galaxies
which are not expected to show any of the expected modified gravity effects.
By comparing statistics of the unscreened sample and screened control
sample, we can place constraints on modified gravity parameters.
The division of observed galaxies into screened and unscreened samples
is accomplished based on an estimate of
the local value of the external gravitational potential at the location
of each galaxy: see \cite{cabre2012} for a description on the methodology
used to distinguish the screened and unscreened sample.
\cite{jainvinu2012} have recently made use of this methodology and
published modified gravity constraints
based on cosmological distance measurements.

In this paper we perform several of the proposed tests of modified gravity
using currently available data. Because of the low signal-to-noise of these
types of tests, a large amount of high quality data will be required to
obtain competitive constraints on modified gravity models.
Therefore, one of the main goals of this paper is to show the strengths and
weaknesses of currently available data for these tests, and explore the
requirements for future data in this area.

In this paper we will consider deviations from GR exhibited in
theories that rely on chameleon screening.
Qualitatively similar behaviour occurs in symmetron screening
\citep{hinterbichler10} and the environmentally dependent
dilaton \citep{brax10} and the tests we  present here apply
to these mechanisms as well\footnote{In order to identify the screened and
  unscreened galaxies it is necessary to calibrate on N-body simulations,
  which give different criteria for different screening mechanisms. While
  we do not implement criteria for any mechanism other than chameleon,  
  our results appear robust to the details of screening.}. 

This paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{pot-sec} we describe the
method to generate potential map of the local Universe, which allows us to
prepare our samples of screened and unscreened galaxies.
In section  \ref{sec:test-summary} we briefly summarize each of the observable
effects we will use to test modified gravity.
In section \ref{sec:offset} we describe the offset between stellar
and gaseous components, which includes:
offset between HI and optical centroid (section \ref{sec:h1-opt-offset}), 
offset between optical center and \ha{} center (section \ref{sec:kinematical}), 
and offset between red giants and main sequence stars centroid (section
\ref{sec:rgb}).
In section \ref{sec:warp} we study warping of edge-on galaxies.
In section \ref{sec:rotationcurves} we describe the tests based on
 gaseous velocity rotation curves, which includes: asymmetry in the
\ha{} curves (section \ref{sec:asymmetry}), HI - \ha{} velocity differences
(section \ref{sec:hihalpha}). We conclude in section \ref{sec:discussion}.

\section{Potential map of the local Universe}
\label{pot-sec}
Each of the modified gravity tests presented in this paper relies on comparing
various observationally-derived statistics of a screened and unscreened sample
of galaxies.
Therefore, the first step of the analysis is to determine whether each
galaxy in our sample is likely to be screened, i.e. the `fifth' force due
to the  scalar field is suppressed by the deep 
potential well of the galaxy or its environment.  
Because the screened sample is free of any fifth-force effects, we use
it as a control sample.  The detailed procedure for 
determining screening has been described and tested via N-body simulations
of $f(R)$ gravity in \cite{cabre2012}; we summarize these results here.

For an isolated spherical halo in $f(R)$ gravity,
the chameleon effect is suppressed if $f_{R0} \leq 2/3\
|\phi_N|/c^2$, where $\phi_N$ is the Newtonian  potential of the object
\citep{hu07}. We will approximate galaxies as isolated spherical halos,
and make use of this condition to determine whether an
object is self-screened or environmentally screened: i.e. we look for the
galaxies which satisfy the following conditions: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:criterion} 
 \frac{|\phi_{\rm int}|}{c^2}>\frac{3}{2} f_{R0}\; \; \; \; \; \; \; \mathrm{or}
\; \; \; \; \; \; \; \frac{|\phi_{\rm ext}|}{c^2}>\frac{3}{2} f_{R0}
\end{equation}
The first condition describes the self-screening condition with 
$ |\phi_{\rm int}|= GM/r_{\rm vir}$, where the $M$ and $r_{\rm vir}$ are the
mass and virial radius. However, low-mass
galaxies may be \textit{environmentally} screened; the second condition is a
simplified attempt to describe this,  with $|\phi_{\rm ext}|$ representing the
Newtonian potential due to the neighbor galaxies within the background Compton
length $\lambda_C$.
The external potential $|\phi_{\rm ext}|$ is evaluated using 
neighboring galaxies as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:criterion22} 
 |\phi_{\rm ext}|= \sum_{d_i<\lambda_C+r_i} \frac{GM_i}{d_i}
\end{equation}
where $d_i$ is the physical distance to the neighboring
galaxy with mass $M_i$ and virial radius $r_i$. $\lambda_C$ is related
to the background field value $f_{R0}$
\citep{sch09}:
\begin{equation}
 \lambda_C \approx 32 \sqrt{\frac{\left|f_{R0}\right|}{10^{-4}}} \mathrm{ Mpc}
 \label{eq:compton}
\end{equation}

Identifying screened and unscreened regions requires knowledge of the masses and
three-dimensional positions of all the objects in the sky.
Since our knowledge is limited by finite survey depths,
we assume that most of the contribution to the potential comes from
clusters and groups of galaxies. This is a reasonable assumption as the
potential of a rich cluster is up to 
two orders of magnitudes larger than a typical galaxy. We
compiled a catalog of bright clusters with known redshifts based on 
Abell \citep{abe89} and ROSAT \citep{ebe96} observations. We remove many
clusters from the Abell catalog as they lack spectroscopic
redshift or have redshift greater than 0.1. Our final catalog contains 675
clusters of galaxies with galactic latitude $\left|b\right| > 20$.

The next most significant contribution comes from galaxy groups. We have a
nearly complete catalog of groups in the SDSS region created by
\citet{yan07}. This covers the redshift range $0.01-0.2$ and includes around
400,000 galaxies. In addition, we use the group catalog from the 2M++ all
sky survey \citep{lav011} to create a combined catalog of
153380 SDSS and 3984 2M++ galaxy groups.
The final contribution to our catalog are
local galaxies within 10 Mpc, identified by \citet{kar04}. 

With this catalog in place, an estimate of the mass of each object
is required in order to calculate the potential.
We determine the mass using either the mass-luminosity relation given by
\citet{rei02} or the mass-velocity dispersion relation given by \citet{evr08}.
The masses of SDSS groups and local galaxies are taken directly from
\citet{yan07} and \citet{kar04}, respectively\footnote{Note
that \citet{kar04} reports the mass for only 313 of the 451 galaxy sample.
See \href{http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~vinu/screening/index.html}{
http://www.sas.upenn.edu/$\sim$vinu/screening/index.html} for an extensive
description of the catalog.}.

Using the mass of the clusters, groups and galaxies, we generate a
potential map of the sky.
In this paper we use values of the Compton length between $\lambda_C
= 3.2$ Mpc and  $\lambda_C = 1.0$ Mpc corresponding to $f_{R0}$ parameters
$10^{-6}$ and $10^{-7}$.  
Due to survey incompleteness, the derived potential map
is only an approximation for many regions of the sky. This could potentially
lead to inaccuracies in labeling of screened and unscreened objects.
A detailed discussion of these uncertainties
can be found in \citet{cabre2012}. 
 
\section{Observable Effects Modified Gravity}
In chameleon gravity theories, objects with large gravitational potential
may be self-screened (see Eq \ref{eq:criterion}).  This may lead to observable
differences in the dynamics of different galactic components: for example,
low-density components such as the gaseous disk, dark matter halo, and giant
stars may feel the fifth force, while the dense, self-screened main sequence
stars move according to standard gravitational dynamics.
The different forces on these components lead to several potentially observable
morphological and kinematical differences between the two components. 


\subsection{Summary of physical effects of modified gravity}

In this section we summarize the  predictions of modified gravity
which will be tested in later sections.  These effects are
expected to appear in the presence of an external
potential gradient, e.g.\ the gravitational attraction of a neighboring
dwarf galaxy (or the effective repulsion of a void).
 Quantitative estimates of the magnitude of these
observables are given  in the following sections. For more
details on these predictions see \citet{bhuvjake2011}. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Offset between stellar and gaseous components (section
\ref{sec:offset}):}
Chameleon theories predict that in the presence of a suitable
potential gradient, low density, unscreened components like dark matter or
neutral hydrogen clouds (HI) can move faster than self-screened stars. 
This may cause a measurable offset between the
centroid of the stellar disk and the gaseous disk. 
The size of the offset
depends strongly on the mass and concentration of the dwarf galaxy's halo,
as well as the distance to neighboring galaxies.
Additionally, the effect may be observable in the offset between the
screened main sequence population, and the partially screened red
giant population.   
%\jakesays{Note expected magnitude of this effect.}
%%BJ: varies too much to give a useful number here, 0.01 to 1 kpc?!

\item \textbf{Warping of the stellar disk (section \ref{sec:warp}):}
As the halo moves along an external potential gradient,
it pulls at the lagging stellar component.  If the potential gradient
is aligned with the axis of rotation, the steep slope of the halo potential
may introduce a U-shaped warp in the stellar disk.
The shape and strength of the warp depends on the mass profile of the dwarf
galaxy halo, as well as the strength of the external potential gradient. The
warp  
 is expected to align with this potential gradient.
citet{bhuvjake2011} estimate the warping to be of order $0.1$ kpc, though it
varies significantly depending on the external fifth force acting on the dwarf
galaxy.  
%\jakesays{Note expected magnitude of this effect.}

\item \textbf{Rotation curve tests (section \ref{sec:rotationcurves}):}
If a disk galaxy falls edge-on, or more generally if the external potential
gradient is not aligned with the galaxy's axis of
rotation, the offset between stellar and halo centers can perturb the stellar
disk
and cause an asymmetry in the stellar rotation curve. This is due to the fact
that the dominant force on the stellar disk is from the potential of the halo,
rather than the potential of the disk itself. The asymmetry
can be as high as 10 km/s. 
The asymmetry can be distinguished from standard astrophysical sources  
by comparing the stellar disk with the gaseous disk.  A version of this test is
show in section 6.2. 

%\item \textbf{Rotation speeds of Gaseous and Stellar disk:}
In principle the rotation velocity of an unscreened gaseous
disk is also enhanced relative to the stellar disk by a factor of
$\sqrt{1 + \Delta G/G}$, where $\Delta G$ is the contribution of the fifth force
to the self-gravity of a galaxy \citep{hui10}. 
We find that current data
is unsuitable to carry out this test: 
see section 6.1 for a discussion of current data and its limitations. 

\end{enumerate}

In isolated cases,
any of the above observable properties could potentially be explained via
standard astrophysical effects.  But under modified gravity we would expect
to see multiple effects in conjunction, and to see offsets and warps
aligned with the external gravitational force.
More importantly, we expect these effects to be more prevalent
in unscreened galaxies than in screened galaxies: such a correlation
would be difficult to explain using conventional explanations for such effects,
such as bars, spiral arms, asymmetric drift, and external tidal effects.
In the following sections, therefore, we explore aggregate statistics
relating to the presence of these observable effects.  

\subsection{Observational Tracers}
\label{sec:halpha}

In order to trace gaseous components of dwarf galaxies,
we use the 21 cm line which results from the hyper fine transition of
neutral hydrogen.
In order to trace the stellar component, we use
optical light, which traces the overall morphology. 
\ha{} may also be used as a kinematical tracer, but there is
some subtlety in the question of whether it is associated
with screened or unscreened matter.

$H_{\alpha}$ emission as a tracer of stellar kinematics 
presents some complications for
studies of modified gravity. The $H_{\alpha}$ emission arises  because
the high energy radiation from stars ionizes the neutral gas in the ISM,
forming a  ``Stromgren Sphere''.
As the ions within this region recombine,
the photons emitted in the $n=3\;\to\;n=2$ transition
of Hydrogen lead to the $H_{\alpha}$ emission line.

Historically, this line has been
used to measure the stellar rotation curve, and is expected to give accurate
measurements of the dynamics of the stellar disk in the absence of modified
gravity. However, when considering the possibility of a fifth force which
affects stars and gas differently, this expectation becomes questionable.
Recall that the star is screened by its own potential, but this potential
may not be strong enough to screen the whole of the surrounding sphere.

A rough calculation shows that for a star of mass $10 M_\odot$ and radius
$5 R_\odot$, the surface potential is $\sim 4\times10^{-6}$. Therefore, this
star will be screened for background field value less than $4\times10^{-6}$.
For $f_{R0} = 1\times10^{-6} (2\times10^{-7})$, this potential is only
sufficient
to screen ionized gas within
$4.6\times10^{-7} (2.3\times10^{-6})$ parsec of the star -- that is, about
4 (20) times the star's radius.
For typical HII regions which have radii of order 10pc, the region screened
by the stellar potential is negligible.  Therefore, we would expect  that the
HII region feels the fifth force and 
orbits faster than the associated star (this raises interesting questions about 
what fraction of stars remain associated with significant HII regions). 
Thus, under the assumptions of
modified gravity,  \ha{} does not appear to trace the dynamics of the stellar
component. We will simply assume that \ha{} is a gaseous tracer and leave 
a detailed study for later work. 

A better tracer of the rotation of the stellar component under modified gravity
may be molecular absorption lines in the stellar spectra, which arise much
closer to the star. Absorption lines such as MgI b or Ca II would trace the
stellar rotation curve accurately under both modified gravity and general
relativity. However, these lines are difficult to observe, particularly
in the low-surface-brightness outskirts of the galaxy. 



\section{Offset between stellar and gaseous components}
\label{sec:offset}

In this section we consider three tests based on the first observable effect:
the expected offset between unscreened and self-screened components of the
unscreened galaxy sample. Simple calculations indicate that under
reasonable approximations, this offset should be large enough to be
observable \citep{bhuvjake2011}.  We consider three potential avenues toward
this observation below.

\subsection{Offset between HI and optical centroids}
\label{sec:h1-opt-offset}
We first  compare the optical centroid, which traces
the stellar component, to the centroid of HI gas measured via its 21cm emission. 
Here the optical observations are taken from the SDSS $r$-band \citep{aba09}
while the HI centroids
are taken from the ALFALFA survey which used the Arecibo radio telescope
\citep{giovanelli2005, gio07, sai08,ken08,mar09}.


The astrometric precision of these observations are limited by the
relatively large beam size of the radio imagery (24 arcsec).
Though the low resolution of the HI image makes any offset difficult to
measure for a single image,
the statistical uncertainty can be reduced by considering a large sample of
galaxies. With this in mind, we note that the ALFALFA team
does not report any systematic difference in the estimates of HI centroid with
mass of the galaxies.
%%BJ I don't know what this means. 
This is important as any such systematic effects
may mimic the modified gravity predictions. i.e.  if they measure systematically
large uncertainty for less massive galaxies compared to massive galaxies, then
such a systematic measurement can mimic the effect we are searching for.

To limit the  uncertainty in the spatial centroiding,
we limit our sample to those galaxies within 40 Mpc.
To minimize the error introduced by the incompleteness in our catalog described
in Section \ref{pot-sec}, we further  restrict our analysis to the SDSS region,
where  we have information on galaxy groups down to a mass of
$5\times 10^{11}M_\odot$.  Finally, to limit the
effects of different detection thresholds between the SDSS and Arecibo
images, we keep only the galaxies whose optical and HI centroids are
within 1 arcmin.  After these cuts are made, the resulting catalog
contains 245 dwarf galaxies.


In order to identify galaxies which are large enough to be self-screened,
we use the maximum velocity estimated from W50, i.e.\ the
velocity width of the source
line profile measured at the 50\% level of each of the two peaks. This was
corrected for instrumental broadening by the ALFALFA team. However, this must
be further corrected for turbulence and inclination.
The turbulence correction was performed according to \citet{tully85} using an
average velocity dispersion in the gas component of 8 km/s \citep{begum06,
geha06}. Finally, we apply the inclination correction based on the observed
axis ratio $q$ in the SDSS r-band. The maximum velocity is found via:
\begin{equation}
  v_{\rm max} = \frac{W50_c}{2 \sqrt{1 - q^2}},
\end{equation}
where $W50_c$ is the turbulence corrected W50 and $q$ is the axis ratio of
the galaxy. For a background field value $f_{R0}$, the unscreened galaxies
satisfy  \citep[see][]{jainvinu2012}
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{v_{\mathrm{max}}}{100}\right)^2 \lesssim
  \frac{f_{R0}}{2\times10^{-7}}.
\label{eq:unscreened}
\end{equation}
The above criteria yields 68 (85) unscreened and 177 (160) screened galaxies
for $f_{R0} = 2 \times10^{-7}$ ($f_{R0} = 10^{-6}$). In figure \ref{fig:offset}
we show the measured offset for samples of different screening level.
The distribution of the observed separations are show in Figure
\ref{fig:offset}.  The errors shown are estimated from the 24 arcsec beam
size of the radio imagery, converted to a physical extent using the
distance to each galaxy.

The interpretation of any observed offset
is made difficult by the fact that there are several potential
astrophysical (non-MG) sources of separation, as well as the fact that we
cannot predict the magnitude or direction of the MG-induced separation.
We address this by proposing an aggregate statistical model of the data,
which takes into account the expected difference between the screened and
unscreened samples.

To account for non-MG related separation, we assume that standard
astrophysical effects will produce a
scatter in the distribution of projected HI-optical separations centered
at zero and with a standard deviation $\sigma_{GR}$.  This scatter will
be present in both the unscreened and self-screened samples.
To account for MG-related separation, we
assume that within the unscreened sample, there will be an additional
Gaussian scatter centered at zero with standard deviation $\sigma_{MG}$.
Then the observed separation for a screened galaxy and an unscreened galaxy
is respectively
\begin{eqnarray}
  \hat{s}^{scr}_i &=& abs(s^{scr}_i) + \varepsilon_i \nonumber\\
  \hat{s}^{unscr}_i &=& abs(s^{unscr}_i) + \varepsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}
where $\hat{s}^{scr}_i$ and $\hat{s}^{unscr}_i$ are the observed offsets
for the screened and unscreened samples, and
 $s^{scr}_i$, $s^{unscr}_i$, and $\varepsilon_i$ are (unobserved) values
drawn from Gaussian distributions:
\begin{eqnarray}
  s^{scr}_i &\sim& \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{GR}^2) \nonumber\\
  s^{unscr}_i &\sim& \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{GR}^2 + \sigma_{MG}^2) \nonumber\\
  \epsilon_i &\sim& \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_i^2)
\end{eqnarray}
where  $\mathcal{N}$ denotes a Gaussian distribution and $\sigma_i$ is the
(known)
measurement error associated with observation $i$.

With this model in place, we can find the most likely parameter combination
within a Bayesian formalism, by writing
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \label{eq:separation_likelihood}
  p(\sigma_{MG}, \sigma_{GR}|\{\hat{s}_i\})
  \propto p(\sigma_{MG})p(\sigma_{GR})
  \left[ \prod_{i \in S^{scr}} g(\hat{s}_i;0, \sigma_{GR}^2 +
\sigma_i^2)\right]\\
\times
  \left[ \prod_{i \in S^{unscr}} g(\hat{s}_i;0, \sigma_{MG}^2 +
\sigma_{GR}^2 + \sigma_i^2)\right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $g(x;\mu,\sigma^2)$ is the Gaussian probability distribution with
mean $\mu$ and width $\sigma$; $p(\sigma_{MG})$ and $p(\sigma_{GR})$ are the
priors on the parameters; and $S^{scr}$ and $S^{unscr}$ are respectively the
sets of screened and unscreened observations.

In figure \ref{fig:offset-analysis} we show the $1-$, $2-$, and $3-\sigma$
contours
of the posterior distribution given in Eqn.~\ref{eq:separation_likelihood}
as a function of $\sigma_{MG}$ and $\sigma_{GR}$.  The left panel shows the
result for the observed data: this data is
not precise enough to rule-out a $\sim 1$kpc scatter due to modified
gravity: this is primarily due to the large observational error in the
measurement of the radio centroid.  In the right panel, we see that
if this astrometric accuracy were to be improved by a factor of 10
(i.e.\ a 2.4arcsec beam),
the observations would be sensitive enough to detect a scatter due to
modified gravity of $~\sim 0.5$kpc, on the order of the offsets
predicted by \citep{bhuvjake2011} for typical MG theories.

One important detail of these results for this dataset is their dependence on
the precise determination of the measurement uncertainty.  Within the model
given by Equation \ref{eq:separation_likelihood}, the measurement error is
degenerate with the astrophysical offset: any increase in assumed measurement
error will be offset by a commensurate decrease in the astrophysical scatter
at maximum likelihood.  Furthermore, because the uncertainty of the measurement
dominates the signal by a factor of up to 4 for each galaxy, even a 10\%
overestimate or underestimate in the beam size will lead to significant
differences in the maximum likelihood fit.  This caveat should be kept in
mind when interpreting Figure \ref{fig:offset-analysis}.

Thus, while the current data are not precise enough to either confirm or
rule-out modified gravity theories, a combined radio/optical survey of
nearby dwarf galaxies with very precise and well-characterized astrometry
could provide strong constraints on typical modified
gravity theories.

\subsection{Offset between optical center and \ha{} kinematical center}
\label{sec:kinematical}
A primary weakness of the measurements explored in the previous section is
the astrometric precision of centroid measurements in the radio.  In
this section we measure the same effect, but using the kinematical
center of the \ha{} disk as a tracer of its centroid.  Here we assume that
the gas producing the \ha{} line is unscreened and traces the dark matter,
which means that the rotation curve should (in principle) have the same
center as the dark matter halo (see Sec \ref{sec:halpha}).
As above, we search for systematic offsets
between the (self-screened) stellar component and this (unscreened) gaseous
component.

For this section, we use data presented by \citet{persic1995}:
they re-analyzed 967 \ha{} velocity rotation curves originally 
observed by \citet{mat92}, and publish the offset between the kinematical
center (which symmetrize the rotation curve) and the optical center.  We divide these galaxies into a screened
and unscreened sample using the methodology presented in Section \ref{pot-sec},
leading to 25 (690) unscreened galaxies and 858 (193) screened galaxies
for $f_{R0} = 2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($f_{R0} = 10^{-6}$).

In the left panel of Fig \ref{offset-kin-den-1}, we show the distance to each
galaxy along with its mass indicator, the maximum rotation velocity. The
mild correlation between them is due to observational bias: smaller, fainter
galaxies are less likely to be observed at larger distances.
Note that velocities range from 50 to 300 km/s, which allow us to test
theories from   $f_{R0}=10^{-6}$ (galaxies self-screened if
$v_\mathrm{max} > 225$ km/s) to $f_{R0}=10^{-7}$ ($v_\mathrm{max} > 70$ km/s).
The color of the points indicates whether the galaxy is screened at a level of
$f_{R0} = 10^{-6.5}$.  There is a relatively sharp boundary between the
screened and unscreened samples seen at $\sim$ 120 km/s rotation velocity: this
is due to the self-screening criterion of larger-mass galaxies.

Because the size of the expected MG displacement scales with the size of the
dark matter halo \citep{bhuvjake2011}, we work with the relative offset
$\delta = s_{obs} / r_{opt}$ where $s_{obs}$ is the offset between the optical
and kinematical centers and $r_{opt}$ is the optical radius of the
galaxy.  This relative offset does not show an obvious correlation with
galaxy rotation velocity, as can be seen in the right panel of Fig
\ref{offset-kin-den-1}.

To search for indications of modified gravity, we use the aggregate likelihood
formalism developed in the previous section.  Here, however, we replace the
absolute deviations $s$ with the relative deviations $\delta$.  The resulting
posterior is shown in Fig \ref{offset-kin-den-2}.  In comparison to the
ALFALFA results in Fig \ref{fig:offset}, the data posterior is
much tighter: this is mainly due to the increased astrometric accuracy
of these measurements.

The left panel of Fig \ref{offset-kin-den-2} shows results for the entire sample, and
(for $f_{R0} = 10^{-6}$) indicates an approximately $1-\sigma$ detection
of an offset due to modified gravity.  Because this result uses the whole
sample, however, there is the potential for this result to be biased by the
sizes of the galaxies in the sample.
As shown in Fig \ref{offset-kin-den-1}, the vast majority of screened galaxies
in our sample are not environmentally screened, but self-screened.  The
differential offset shown in this analysis, then, is not only tracing the
difference between screened and unscreened galaxies: it is also tracing
the difference between large and small galaxies.  Even without modified
gravity effects, we may expect statistically significant differences in
observed offsets between these samples.

To limit the effect of this size bias, we repeat the analysis, limiting our
galaxy sample to those with a maximum rotation velocity less than
200 km/s (i.e.\ those galaxies below the dashed line in
Fig \ref{offset-kin-den-1}.  Having controlled for this bias, we see in
the left panel of Fig \ref{offset-kin-den-2} that the offsets are consistent
with General Relativity.

This analysis, however, does not rule out offsets due to modified gravity
with a scatter of approximately 2\% of the optical radius of the galaxy.
Under ideal conditions, \citet{bhuvjake2011} showed that the expected
offsets for typical modified gravity theories could be as high as 10\% the
optical radius of the galaxy.  This predicted offset decreases as the size
of the galaxy increases, and as the distance to the neighboring galaxy
increases.  Thus a 2\% offset is not enough to definitively
rule-out modified gravity theories.
% : a better test would limit the sample to
% those which are below the self-screening threshold (to limit the size bias
% discussed above) and to those galaxies which have a suitable neighbor
% (\citet{bhuvjake2011} study galaxies which have a neighbor within $\sim$10
% virial radii. Unfortunately, performing such cuts
% on the current sample leaves too few galaxies to perform
%  a meaningful analysis.

In conclusion, this probe is statistically competitive, since the astrometric
error is less than 5\% of the galaxy size, and we are looking for a modified
gravity effect of the same order.  After limiting the sample to partially
control for the size bias, we find that our data are consistent with GR,
but still cannot rule-out effects on the order of those expected within
 MG framework.

\subsection{Offset between centroids of red giants and main sequence stars}
\label{sec:rgb}
%\cite{angst2009}
In modified gravity scenarios, red giant stars present an interesting case:
their cores may be dense enough to self-screen, while their diffuse outer
shells remain unscreened and feel the fifth force.  This partial screening
can lead to interesting effects: for example, 
\citet{changhui} have recently shown that red giant stars evolve differently
under modified gravity compared to main sequence stars, and that this
difference can be used to constrain modified gravity theories.

In this section we make use of red giant populations
to constrain modified gravity in a different way:
just as unscreened gas and dark matter will separate from
the screened main sequence stars in the presence
of an external potential gradient, partially screened red giants
will be expected to separate from the population
of main sequence stars as well.

\subsubsection{Data and centroid estimation of RGB and main sequence stars}
Recently, \citet{dalcanton09} published positions and magnitudes
of stars of 69 nearby dwarf galaxies (distance $<$ 4 Mpc , $|b| > 20$ deg)
\footnote{See
\href{http://www.nearbygalaxies.org}{http://www.nearbygalaxies.org}}.
Absolute magnitudes of these galaxies ($M_B$) range from -20 to -8. They  
observed nearly $10^3$ to $10^5$ stars in each galaxy.
In our study we need full images of the galaxies to estimate the displacement
between RGB (red giant branch) and main sequence stellar populations as partial
images of galaxies introduce artificial displacement between those two
populations. We use only those galaxies which pass this criterion. In
addition to that, we exclude all the galaxies with color-magnitude diagram
which poorly defines the RGB stars due to the contamination of foreground stars.
Finally, we include galaxies only if they have at least 3000 observed stars.
The final sample consists of 28 galaxies: under either screening assumption
($f_{R0}=10^{-6}$ and $f_{R0}=10^{-7}$) every galaxy is unscreened,
which means this test cannot rely on a screened control sample.


For each galaxy, we select red giants from the 
color-magnitude diagram. In Fig \ref{fig:selectrg} we show an example of
red giant star selection.
Because the fifth force acts only on the outer regions of the largest giant
stars, we tune the cutoff to select only the brightest, and therefore the
largest, of the red giant stars.
Next we define the area of the galaxy within which
the centroid will be calculated.
This is done by taking isocontours of stellar number density significantly
above the noise level. It should be noted that we can study the lopsidedness or
asymmetry of the galaxy by comparing the centroid position of main sequence
stars in different isocontours and we make use of the asymmetry measurement
latter in this section. Errors in the centroids of red giants or main
sequence stars are calculated using bootstrap resampling with 50 realizations.
These are shot-noise dominated.
Since the number of red giants is at least one order of
magnitude lower than main sequence stars, the error  in the centroid
displacement is basically dominated by the error in the centroid position of
red giants.

\subsubsection{Estimation of external force}
Because of the lack of control sample, detecting modified gravity here
depends on correlating the direction of displacement with the strength
and direction of the background gravitational potential gradient at
each dwarf galaxy due to its neighbors.  In order to estimate this,
we use the
catalog of  nearby galaxies given by \citet{kar04}. This catalog is nearly
complete out to a distance of 10 Mpc and it contains a total of 431 galaxies
with known mass for 313 galaxies. We fit a linear relation between the
mass and magnitude (in logarithmic scale) to the galaxies with known mass and
use this empirical relation to estimate the masses of the remaining galaxies.
By using distances and masses of neighboring galaxies we can construct the
force vector (per unit mass) as 

\begin{equation}
\vec{a} =\sum_{i \in {\rm unscr}}{\frac{G M_i}{|\vec{r_i}
-\vec{r}|^2} \frac{\vec{r_i}
-\vec{r}}{|\vec{r_i} -\vec{r}|} }
\label{eq:accelaration}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the studied galaxy mass at position $\vec{r}$,
 $M_i$ the mass of the
neighbor $i$, which is at position $\vec{r_i}$ and G is Newton's
constant. The sum includes only unscreened neighbors at a distance below the
Compton length. 
The gravitational potential W can be calculated as 

\begin{equation}
 W=\sum_i{\frac{G M_i}{|\vec{r_i} -\vec{r}|}  }
\end{equation}
Here we include all neighbors at a distance below the Compton length. We use the
potential to define the level of screening of our sample of  galaxies as
described in \cite{cabre2012}. The force has some errors due to the
uncertainty in distance (5\%) and mass ($\sigma_{log(M)}=0.2$).
In our case, uncertainty in mass is the
dominant source of error. 

\subsubsection{Results and comparison with theory}
In Fig \ref{fig:rgdispprojforce} we plot the displacement of red
giants from  main sequence stars projected to the external force vector as a 
function of the force per unit mass. The force vector is previously
projected to the plane of the sky 
perpendicular to the line of sight, where we did the displacement measurement.
In order to calculate the error in the projected displacement, 
we take into account both the error in the centroids and the error in the
vector force. We show the results on the left and right panels  
for $f_{R0}=10^{-6}$ and $f_{R0}=10^{-7}$ respectively. The correlation between
the projected displacement and the force applied is -0.2  
for $f_{R0}=10^{-6}$ and -0.3 for $f_{R0}=10^{-7}$, not significant in any  case
given the number of galaxies and d.o.f. 
%\jakesays{We should quote the uncertainties on these correlations.}
The weighted average displacement in the direction of the 
external force for $f_{R0} = 10^{-6}$ ($f_{R0} = 10^{-7}$) is
$-10.2\pm5.5$ pc ($-4.7\pm6.4$ pc),
consistent with zero to within 2-$\sigma$ (1-$\sigma$).
The errors on these estimates include intrinsic dispersion, as explained
in Appendix \ref{ap:avg}.

This analysis indicates that offset does not correlate with force, in opposition
to the expectations from modified gravity.  Modified gravity would also predict
that the offset direction would be preferentially aligned with the force direction
for stronger external forces: this comparison also displays no clear correlation.

%In Fig \ref{fig:rganglepot}, we look at the angle between the
%force and the displacement vs the potential created by the neighbors. 
%The error in the angle is calculated taking into account the contribution from
%the displacement error and force error.
%The colors indicate the
%displacement strength, from lower to higher values (darker to lighter colors). 
%We do not see any significant correlation between the angle and the potential.
%We would expect that lighter colors (larger displacements) are more
%clustered at lower angles (more aligned with the force) and for lower potentials
%(more unscreened in theory). 

In Fig \ref{fig:rgdisppred} we compare the projected displacement to the
prediction, given the external force and assuming a cored isothermal sphere
(see Eq 2.3 of \cite{bhuvjake2011} for the analytical expression of the offset).
The prediction takes into account errors in neighboring masses, distances, as well as
error in the galaxy mass, core radius and core mass. These last two
measurements are estimated based on the strong empirical correlation
between virial mass and core radius and core mass \citep{swaters03,swaters11}.
The dispersion in the correlation is also included. We have assumed $\Delta G/G =1$
for the predictions, but this result can be easily scaled for other values of 
$\Delta G/G$.
The mean difference between the observed displacement $d$ and predicted
displacement $p$ is $p-d=12.5\pm6.1$ pc ($-0.7\pm4.8$ pc) for
$f_{R0} = 10^{-6}$ ($10^{-7}$)

We see that the results are not inconsistent with either GR or modified
gravity.  The main reason for this lack of
discriminatory power is because most of the galaxies are very isolated,
so the external force has a small magnitude.

Finally we note that we have ignored the contribution
of voids to the potential gradient: this is difficult to quantify, but could
be an important contribution in very low density regions as these ones. In
Appendix \ref{ap:rgb-systematics} we discuss a series of important systematics
involve in this test.

relativity.

general relativity, and it is difficult to rule out any modified gravity theory
given the large errors in the predictions and systematics.}
\label{fig:rgdisppred}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Future directions}
We find that tests of modified gravity through
comparison of the positions of red giant and main sequence stars
are inconclusive, mainly oweing to the error associated with the
small sample size.  Also, because red giants are only
partially screened, the signal may be diluted when compared to
the tests of the previous sections.
Additionally, the lack of a control sample means that
the uncertainty in the external force is the limiting factor
if one wants to constrain modified gravity with only the unscreened sample as
such tests require much better prediction to compare the data. 

Future studies making use of this effect should focus on unscreened galaxies
with very close neighbors, which will thus experience stronger external
potential gradients, and drive the separation to more detectable levels.
It would also be helpful to focus on similarly-sized screened galaxies to
provide a control sample (though this pursuit may be limited by the relative
paucity of nearby screened dwarf galaxies).  
The best approach would be to focus on a limited number of galaxies with
regular morphology, to reduce intrinsic systematic effects, with a very well defined
external force.

Another potentially interesting method 
for this sort of measurement would be to use integral field
spectra of galaxies and estimate the red giant and main sequence contributions
to the spectrum as a function of position: any systematic offset, aligned with
the external fifth force in the inferred mass of red giant and main sequence
stars could indicate the presence of a fifth force acting on the red giant
population.




\section{Warping of edge-on galaxies}
\label{sec:warp}

%\jakesays{
%  For this section, I think we could move the detailed discussion of
%  quantifying the warp into an appendix, so that we don't impede the
%  flow of the paper.}
%\vinusays{I would say we need to keep that here as it is important text}
In the previous section, we discussed the expected offset of the stellar
and dark matter components of suitable unscreened dwarf galaxies within
modified gravity.  As shown in \citet{bhuvjake2011}, this offset may lead
to an observable morphological signature: a bowl-shaped warp in the stellar
disk, aligned with the direction of the external gravitational force and this
effect will be maximized when the gravitational
force is perpendicular to the plane of the disk. When viewed edge-on,
this will result in a symmetric U-shaped warp in the disk of the infalling
galaxy.  Because standard astrophysical dynamics (e.g. tides) could lead to
similar effects, we use screened galaxies as a control sample and look for
a statistically significant higher fraction of such U-shaped warps in the
unscreened sample.

\subsection{Data and estimation of warp parameter}
We search for warp in low mass, nearly edge-on galaxies using the
ALFALFA and SDSS data. The rotation velocity measured by the former is used to
find self-screened galaxies and images from the latter is used to estimate warp
parameter. Because warp is difficult to observe in face-on
galaxies, we limit our sample to those galaxies with an axis ratio
of less than 0.6. In the resulting sample of 495 galaxies, 128 (59) 
galaxies are screened and 367 (158) unscreened, for a Compton scale length of 3
(1) Mpc which corresponds to $f_{R0}=1 \times 10^{-6}$ ($f_{R0}=2 \times
10^{-7}$). For $f_{R0}=2 \times 10^{-7}$ we use only galaxies with
$v_\mathrm{max} < 200$ km/s in the screened sample.

In order to reduce the type of mass-related systematic effects discussed in
the previous  section, we include only smaller galaxies in which the
self-screening condition (Eq.\ \ref{eq:unscreened}) does not apply: the
separation of screened and
unscreened galaxies is based only on the environment.
The warp of the galaxies is found by slightly modifying the method used
in \citet{jim97}: after sky subtraction, we first rotate the SDSS images
so that the major axis of the galaxies align with the horizontal axis.
The center of rotation is found using the SExtractor package \citep{bertin96}.
We mask stars and other contaminating
nearby objects in the image. After removing all the contaminating objects and
pixels in the frame we find the centroids
for each column in the image by fitting a Gaussian to the column and taking the
first moment. This leads to a `warp curve', i.e. the centroid of the
columns as a function of distance from the center of the galaxies.
To clean the curve, we starting from the center of the galaxy and
sweep through the curve, omitting any column which has a linearly-interpolated
centroid that deviates more than three pixels from that of the previous column.
An example of such a cleaned warp curve is shown on Fig \ref{warp-eg}.

\end{figure*}

After estimating the warp curve, we quantify the warp by defining the
following two warp measures:

\begin{equation}
w_1 =  \frac{\int_0^L \frac{x}{L} \frac{y}{L} \frac{dx}{L}}{\int_0^L
\frac{x}{L}\frac{dx}{L}}=\frac{2}{L^3} \int_0^L x y dx
\label{warp-param} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w_2 = \frac{\int_0^L{x y dx}}{\int_0^L{x dx}}=\frac{2}{L^2} \int_0^L x y dx
\label{warp-param2} 
\end{equation} 
for the left ($x < 0$) and right ($x \geq 0$) side of the galaxy.

$w_1$ is dimensionless and proportional to the mean $y/L$ displacement from the
$x$-axis weighted by the distance from the center ($x/L$),
where $L = \max(|x|)$.
The normalizing factor ($1/L$) assures that $w_1$ is independent
of the choice of the measurement unit.

$w_2$ is measured in units of kpc. $w_2$ is the average deviation from a
horizontal plane of the galaxy weighted by $x$ (horizontal axis). One of the
main reasons to use this definition of warp is that $w_2$ give the physical
size of the warp strength which might help the observers.  We
correct this warp for the inclination of the galaxy based on \citet{geha06}.
This is done by dividing the measured warp curve by $\sin(i)$ where $i =
\sqrt{\frac{1 - (b/a)^2}{1 - 0.19^2}}$ with a disk thickness of 0.19.


The warp is estimated within three half-light radii of the galaxy (beyond
this radius, the images tend to become very noisy).  The results of this
section are insensitive to the choice of this cutoff: they do not vary
appreciably as this limit is changed from 2 to 4 half-light radii.
In each warp measure, the error is calculated via standard propagation
of the width of each column centroid.

\subsection{Results}
We classify the warp as ``U-shaped'' if $w_i$ ($i=$1 or 2) has opposite signs on
the left
and right sides, and ``S-shaped'' if the signs match.
To quantify the warp strength, we average the absolute values of the
warp in the left and right sides of the galaxy. In Appendix
\ref{ap:warp-distri} we use another estimator and show that all the results in
this section remains unchanged.
Figure \ref{fig:warp-distr} shows the normalized distribution of $w_1$ 
(left panel) and $w_2$ (right panel) 
for screened and unscreened galaxies displaying a
U-shaped warp. The errors in the histograms are estimated using Poisson
statistics in each bin.

It is expected from modified gravity theory that unscreened galaxies with
close-by neighbors will preferentially show large U-shaped warps.
A K-S test shows that the $w_1$ distributions are similar. This
implies that there is no dependence of warp on the screening level of the
galaxy. 
% \jakesays{can K-S tests take into account errors? }\vinusays{The
% current test
% doesn't which could be a problem} \jakesays{This is an important weakness:
% we should seek another approach.  I think the likelihood-based approach
% from the previous section could also apply here.}\vinusays{I guess for this
% section we may leave as it is unless the referee has serious objection.}
However, we find that $w_2$ distributions are
marginally different: the unscreened galaxies are slightly more warped. The
null hypotheses that the screened and unscreened distributions are identical is
accepted only with a probability $\sim$ 0.88.
In Appendix \ref{ap:distance-systematic} we show that this difference can be
attributed to size or
distance bias. In Appendix \ref{ap:warp-distri} we show that the distributions
of warp
do not change even if we include all kind (S-type, U-type, normal) of
galaxies in the analysis.

Eq.\ref{warp-param} and the  right panel is for the warp parameter
calculated using Eq.\ref{warp-param2}. Both parameters are measured within 3
times the half light radius of the galaxies. No significant difference is found
between the distributions of warp of  screened and unscreened galaxies on
the left and a marginal difference is found on the right with more warp
for unscreened galaxies. This discrepancy can be solved if we consider size
bias.}
\label{fig:warp-distr}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}





The distance-dependent effect, described in Appendix
\ref{ap:distance-systematic}, suggests that the ideal way to
compare the $w_2$ of screened and unscreened samples is to consider galaxies of
similar size. The left panel of Figure \ref{fig:size-warp-kpc} shows the
warp $w_2$ versus the half light radius of galaxies. As we expected, the
warp is larger for bigger galaxies. The small dots are
the measured value and large dots with errorbar shows the average and dispersion
of $w_2$ within 0.5 kpc bins (see Appendix \ref{ap:avg}).
The lines shows the best fit linear relation between the
half light radius and the warp and the slopes of those relations are given
in the top left corner. It can be seen that when considering galaxies of
similar size the warp is identical for unscreened and screened galaxies.
So we do interpret the difference seen in the right panel of Figure
\ref{fig:warp-distr} as due to measurement bias. 

\subsection{Comparison with theory}
Our analysis of galaxy warp shows that there exists no significant
difference between the occurrence of warps in screened and unscreened
samples. Here we use this non-detection to place 
limits on strength of the fifth force. Given the low levels of observed warps, 
we assume that any contribution 
due to modified gravity will be added linearly to astrophysical effects
which are estimated from the screened sample. 
So we subtract the measured warp of unscreened and screened 
sample to estimate a possible MG contribution. 

We find the average warp ($\langle w_1\rangle$) and error on the average 
using the method described in Appendix \ref{ap:avg}. We find that $\langle
w_1\rangle=0.035 \pm 0.014$ for unscreened galaxies and $\langle
w_1 \rangle=0.032 \pm 0.020$ for screened galaxies (i.e. the
warp due to astrophysical process is a 3\% effect) for $f_{R0} =
2\times10^{-7}$. This implies that the estimated warp in a modified gravity
scenario ($\hat{w}_{MG}$) is as low as $0.003 \pm 0.024$ (0.3\%). See Table
\ref{tab:warp} for
the results of other background field values. We can use this in conjunction
with a theoretical expectation of the warp strength to place loose
constraints on modified gravity. This expected warp can be estimated
as described by \citet{bhuvjake2011}; the result 
is sensitive to the mass profile of the galaxy,
as well as the strength of the external potential gradient. 
Unfortunately, both these are difficult to determine from the data.
Therefore, we follow the assumption that a galaxy will
squire a velocity of $\sim 100$ km/s (typically observed) in 3 Gyr, due to
modified gravity \citep{bhuvjake2011}.
This gives an acceleration of $\sim 10^{-15}$ km/s$^2$
% Therefore, we follow
% the argument described in section \ref{sec:h1-opt-offset}. i.e. we
% assume each galaxy
% will have an acceleration of $\sim 10^{-15}$ km/s. 
Also, we need to consider
the direction of this force at the galaxy to get the effective force to
generate the warp. We marginalize over the angle by averaging
1000 random angles between -90 deg and 90 deg. The mass at a given
radius of the
galaxy is found by the assumption of cored isothermal sphere. Based on these
assumptions we generate warp curves for these galaxies. However, we do not
attempt to calculate the error in the model prediction for individual galaxies. 
This analysis predicts $w_{MG}= 0.003_{0.001}^{0.003}$ for
$\Delta G/G = 1/3$ and $w_{MG}=0.006_{0.003}^{0.006}$ for
$\Delta G/G = 1$. The errors are the scatter in the predicted warp distribution.
%%BJ what are these errors?

Average values of $w_2$ for galaxies of different sizes are calculated
and are shown in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:size-warp-kpc} and Table
\ref{tab:warp}. The filled and open circles with error bar in the figure show
the measured value of warp for $f_{R0} = 2 \times10^{-7}$ and $f_{R0} = 1
\times10^{-6}$. The red and green lines show the expected warp for $\Delta G/G
= 1$ and $1/3$.
It can be seen that the measured value is not precise enough to distinguish
between modified gravity and GR (which corresponds to $\Delta G/G = 0$).
The large error is due primarily to the relatively small sample of galaxies.
% If future surveys increase the number of suitable galaxies for this type
% of study, the warp distribution may lead to a powerful test of modified
% gravity predictions. 
%%BJ get rid of the second case? or separate panel for it?

the half light radius and warp for $f_{R0} = 2 \times10^{-7}$. The slopes of

\label{fig:size-warp-kpc}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}



Finally, we need to point out that all the tests we perform in this section is
based on the warp estimators $w_1$ and $w_2$. Those are the average of the
absolute values of warp of left and right sides of the galaxy,
i.e, $(\left|w_L\right|$ + $\left|w_R\right|)/2$. However, it is not the only
possible estimator. In Appendix \ref{ap:warp-distri} we define another
estimator, $(\left|w_L\right|$ - $\left|w_R\right|)/2$, and show that all the
conclusions remain same.



 

\subsection{Future Directions}
Our results for the warping of disk galaxies are consistent with GR. 
We find that using our current sample of nearly 500 galaxies, 
it is not possible to constrain $f(R)$ type 
modified gravity theories.  
The two main reasons are: 1. the limited number of galaxies
with kinematic data (like ALFALFA) which are required to classify galaxy
into screened and unscreened samples, and, 2. lack of estimates of halo
parameters to use in the prediction.  

Based on our estimates of
uncertainties in the measured and predicted warps we can estimate
the number of galaxies with kinematic data required to
reduce the error in the observed warp by a factor of 8 (so that
the measurement error is comparable to the uncertainty in the predictions). 
We need $\sim 8,000$ dwarf galaxies to test $f_{R0} =
2\times10^{-7}$ and $\sim 20,000$ galaxies for $f_{R0} =
1\times10^{-6}$ (calculated from third and fourth lines of Table
\ref{tab:warp}). This assumes that the halo parameters have the same accuracy as we have in
this paper.  Note also that even though the number of
galaxies required to test $f_{R0} = 2\times10^{-7}$ is a factor of two
less than that of $f_{R0} = 1\times10^{-6}$, those galaxies should be
very low mass and isolated and therefore require deep surveys. It is
possible to get better optical images from ongoing 
galaxy surveys (e.g Dark Energy Survey). In addition, we would 
require spectroscopic or 21cm surveys that measure rotation velocities. 
(Optical magnitudes can serve as proxies for halo mass, but have significant
uncertainties.)







\section{Stellar and gaseous velocity rotation curves}
\label{sec:rotationcurves}

\subsection{HI-H$\alpha$ velocity difference}\label{sec:hihalpha}
\vinusays{CHECK this section}
Historically, \ha{} emission  is used to measure stellar rotation
curve. However, our calculation in section \ref{sec:halpha} shows that
this is not true under modified gravity scenario. On the other hand,
our simple calculation may not reflect the full astrophysical effects
affecting the stellar rotation and it is possible that our calculation
may carry some uncertainty. Therefore, in this section we compare \ha{}
rotation curve with the one observed using HI. The latter is
associated with unscreened gaseous component. Any similarity between
these two may indicate that \ha{} traces unscreened component under
modified gravity scenario.


In order to estimate the difference between HI and \ha{} rotation
curves, we extract HI and \ha{} data from Fig 3 of \citet{Swaters2009}, which
contains 22 galaxies. The errors in $v_{HI}$ were obtained by private
communication with Swaters.  Each HI observation has one or two \ha{}
counterparts (see the references there). Apart from this we have \ha{} data for
14 galaxies from GHASP. Note that all galaxies in the sample are unscreened due
to their low mass and lack of massive neighbors. In Fig \ref{h1-ha-rot-eg} we
show the comparison of HI and \ha{} rotation curves for two galaxies taken from
\citet{Swaters2009}. As we  anticipiated the data show a variety of signatures.
The first galaxy UGC 10310 has HI $>$ \ha{} as modified gravity would predict if
\ha{}  was associated with stars, while UGC 3137 has \ha~ $>$ HI.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/H1-HA-rot-eg.png}
\caption{In this figure the dots with error bar represent rotation
curve determined from \ha{} and line shows HI measurement. If we assume that
the \ha{} traces the stellar velocity, this figure shows two extreme
examples of the situation.  Modified gravity theories predict that the star
rotates slower than the gas. In the left panel we show one such
galaxy. The right panel shows the opposite trend where stars rotate faster
than HI. These images are taken from \citet{Swaters2009}.}
\label{h1-ha-rot-eg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


To quantify the difference between HI and \ha{} rotation curves statistically
we do the following. 1. Average both sides of the HI and \ha{} rotation curves
separately about a common center. This reduces observational uncertainty in the
measured rotation curves. 2. The averaged HI and \ha{} curves are used to
estimate the weighted average of the difference between HI and \ha{}, $\Delta
v = v_{HI} - v_{H\alpha}$.
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:deltavv}
% |\Delta v |=\left | \sum_j\left(\frac{v_j^s-v_j^g}{\sigma_j^2}\right)
% \Big/\sum_j\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_j^2}\right) \right |
% \end{equation}
% with error
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:deltav2}
% \sigma_{|\Delta v|}=\sqrt{1\Big/\sum_j\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_j^2}\right)}
% \end{equation}
% where $v_j^s$ and $v_j^g$ represent the average velocities of 
% \ha{} and HI in
% radial bin $j$ from the center of the galaxy and $\sigma_j$ is the error
% associated with that. 
If both \ha{} and HI rotates similarly, then the $\Delta v$ follow a  Gaussian
distribution centered at zero.
In Fig \ref{h1-ha-rot} we plot the distribution of $v_{HI}-v_{H\alpha}$ in
black for \citet{Swaters2009} data. When more than one
H$\alpha$ measurements are provided for the same galaxy, we weight equally the
contribution of each  $\Delta v$ to the mean in order to take into account
just one galaxy count. If we add errors
in observations we get the red histogram. In blue, we plot the Gaussian that
best fits our data.
% Fig. \ref{h1-ha-rot} is just used for illustrative purpose.
In order to take into account individual errors and
intrinsic dispersion to calculate the mean and the error we follow the
procedure described in Appendix \ref{ap:avg}.

\includegraphics[trim= 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip = true,

\caption{The difference between HI and \ha~ velocity curves.
We plot the distribution of $\Delta {v}=v_{HI}-v_{H\alpha}$ for
\citet{Swaters2009} data (black histogram). In red we plot the same
once we add individual errors in the $\Delta v$ measurements. We over plot in
blue the best Gaussian. We label the mean $\Delta v$ on the plot. This
shows that rotation curves determined from \ha{} and HI agree.}
\label{h1-ha-rot}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


We obtain $\langle \Delta v\rangle=0.11\pm 1.50 \pm 5$ km/s (statistical and
systematic error, explained below) when we use HI and \ha~
from Fig 3 of \citet{Swaters2009}.
i.e. the rotation curves measured from HI and \ha{}  rotation are
consistent with each other. This implies that if modified gravity
 exists then \ha{} is likely to trace the gaseous component of the galaxy.
% , using all the range where we haveinformation on both \ha~ and HI. 
When we only use H$\alpha$ from GHASP, the
statistical error increases to 3.5 km/s.
% The fractional difference between the velocities using the data from
% \citet{Swaters2009} i.e. 
% $\langle \Delta v / v_{HI}\rangle=0.006\pm 0.020\pm 0.060$. 

The systematic error in the above result, by combining different \ha{}
observations and testing  different ranges in the velocity curve, is around 2
km/s. In the calculation above we did not correct the HI rotation
curves for asymmetric drift. For late type galaxies this correction may be less
than or nearly $\sim 3$ km/s \citep{Swaters2009, deblok2002}. The error in the
rotation curves include those due to both measurement and non-circular motions,
which were found by taking the difference between approaching and receding
sides. See \citet{Swaters2009} for details. This is another important
systematic issue when testing the asymmetry of the HI/\ha{} curves as the non
circular motions can potentially mimic the signatures of modified gravity as
described in the next section.
the previous section. Nevertheless the systematic error on the HI curve should
be less than 5 km/s.


\subsection{Asymmetry in \ha~ rotation curves}\label{sec:asymmetry}

In the previous section, we show that even under modified gravity scenario
the \ha{} is likely to trace the gaseous component of the galaxy. This implies
that the \ha{} rotation curve will be perfectly symmetric about the
center of dark matter halo. On the other hand, the dark matter halo will be
offset from the stellar component and therefore the \ha{} curve will be
asymmetric with respect to the optical centroid. It should be noted that the
asymmetry in the HI or \ha{} rotation curve is a manifestation of the offset
between the stellar and dark matter halo and this effect is distinctly
different from the asymmetry in stellar rotation curve predicted by
\citet{bhuvjake2011}. Nonethless, the oder of this asymmetry is 10-15 km/s. In
this section we use \ha{} rotation curves to preform the test which check
whether gaseous rotation curves are asymmetric about the stellar centroid. Any
positive signal may light the presence of fifth force. This
is done by comparing the approaching and receding sides of \ha{} rotation curves
about the stellar centroid.

\subsubsection{Data and visual classification of rotation curves}
We use \ha{} rotation curves for nearly 200 disk
galaxies from  the Gassendi \ha{} survey of SPirals (GHASP) archive
\citep[see][and references therein]{epinat08a} to search for asymmetry in
rotation curves. GHASP is an \ha{} kinematic survey of spiral and
irregular galaxies. This survey has already observed $\sim 220$ galaxies, and
provides the rotation curves for both
approaching and receding sides separately. We correct the velocities for
inclination by assuming thin circular disk.
% In this sample, the main contributors determine the screening level is
% the 2MASS groups and clusters.  Because of the mass limit and
% completeness of these catalogs, we cannot find the screening level for
% $f_{R0}<10^{-6.5}$. Most of the GHASP galaxies are in low density regions.
% There are 52 galaxy curves with rotation velocities below 120 km/s and 40 of
% these are unscreened and remaining 12 galaxies are screened. Below 120km/s, 
% six galaxies show either large asymmetry in their rotation curves that may
% not be created by  modified gravity or have a few  observed points to define
% the symmetry. We called these rotation curves irregular, mainly unscreened.
% There are 42 galaxies that show highly symmetric curves (similar fraction of
% screened and unscreened ones) and 4 galaxies which show asymmetric curves in
% a smooth way (as predicted by modified gravity). Only 2 of these are
% unscreened, UGC7831 and UGC10310.\\
% For galaxies with velocities above 120km/s, which are screened by
% themselves, we find 120 symmetric, 10 asymmetric and 8 irregular curves.\\

We visually inspect these rotation curves and classify them into symmetric,
smoothly asymmetric and irregular. We show a sample of symmetric curves in Fig
\ref{fig:GHASPsym} and smoothly asymmetric in Fig \ref{fig:GHASPasym} in
Appendix \ref{ap:curves}. In a modified gravity scenario, we expect the gaseous
rotation curves to be smoothly asymmetric about the stellar
centroid \citep{bhuvjake2011}.
We removed all the irregular rotation curves which have too few
observed points and/or small-scale discontinuities.
The later could more likely be created by
small-scale  astrophysical effects.
We find that in both the screened and unscreened sample, symmetric curves
outnumber smoothly asymmetric curves by a factor of four. We need to
emphasize that the galaxies with asymmetric \ha{} curves may be ideal for the
future search for modified gravity.
We also find irregular rotation to be more common among unscreened (small)
galaxies.
We visually inspect optical images of these galaxies
and find that irregular \ha~ rotation curves are mostly
associated with dim or morphologically irregular galaxies.


\subsubsection{Analysis}
Quantitatively, we have looked at asymmetry in rotation curves for each galaxy
using the abolute value of the weighted average of difference between
approaching and receding sides of the rotation curves ($|\Delta v|$) about the
stellar centroids \citep{epinat08a}. This asymmetry is better seen near the
center of the galaxy and therefore we mostly used the inner part of the
rotation curves. However, we found that our results do not depend
significantly on the definition of inner part of the rotation curve. Finally,
we divide $|\Delta v|$ by the maximum rotation velocity (from now on we call it
as asymmetry $a$) since we expect both astrophysical intrinsic effects and
modified gravity to scale with mass (or velocity).  The error in the asymmetry
includes both measurement error and intrinsic dispersion $\sigma_a$, which
can be same order of magnitude, we follow the method described in  Appendix
\ref{ap:avg}. Similar to the previous sections, we assume that
the asymmetry of unscreened galaxy, $a^U$, includes the contribution from
modified gravity $a^{MG}$ and astrophysical effects ($a^X$) added linearly. We
determine the latter from the screened galaxies

% 
% \begin{equation}
% a^S=a^X\pm \sigma_a^S
% \end{equation}
% For unscreened (U) galaxies, the asymmetry is 
% \begin{equation}
%  a^U=a^X+a^{MG}\pm \sigma_a^U
% \end{equation}
% By combining both results, we get the asymmetry introduced by modified gravity
%  \begin{equation}
%   a^{MG}=(a^U-a^S)\pm\sqrt{(\sigma_a^U)^2+(\sigma_a^S)^2}
%  \end{equation}


\subsubsection{Results}
In Fig \ref{fig:plotsGHASP} we summarize our results. We plot  $a$
as a function of maximum rotation velocity of the galaxies for
$f_{R0}=10^{-6}$. There are 68 unscreened galaxies
(shown as red dots) and 58 screened galaxies (black).
We compute the asymmetry within centrall 0.3 times the optical radius of the
galaxy. The diamond symbols large $a$ show
galaxies with visual asymmetry in the rotation curve which look interesting
under modified gravity theories. Squares indicate barred
galaxies and empty circles represent irregular cases. The asymmetry is not
driven by these type of irregularities as we found that there is no
correlation between those feature and asymmetry. The filled circles with
errorbar on the lower left corner show the average asymmetry and the error.
The values are also shown in the plot. We find that the asymmetry for both
screened and unscreened galaxies is around 7\% which corresponds to
10 and 20 km/s for low and high velocity galaxies. This implies that
the asymmetry produced by modified gravity is $a^{MG}=-0.001\pm 0.012$.
Also, we find that for $f_{R0}=10^{-6.5}$ (24 unscreened galaxies and 102
screened galaxies) $a^{MG}=0.024\pm 0.015$.
i.e. our results are consistent with zero for both cases of $f_{R0}$ at
2-$\sigma$ level. A 10\% asymmetry
created by modified gravity can be ruled out at 5-$\sigma$ level given the
errors in the measurement for both cases. See Table \ref{tablefinal} for a
summary in the results. It should be noted that we do not attempt to estimate
the systematic errors due to asymmetric drift and non-circular motion make our
result weaker.

We have studied the correlation between asymmetry
and the number of neighbors, distance to the nearest significant neighbor
etc. and found no correlation. \citet{garrido05} also studied asymmetry in
GHASP H$\alpha$ rotational curves. They conclude that isolated and softly
interacting galaxies have the same asymmetries which might be due to
inhomogeneous massive star formation regions.
\vinusays{We conclude with a note on the sample used in this
section that the galaxies in the screened sample are mostly due to
self-screening. This may be an important drawback of this test and the reason
is explained in section \ref{sec:caveat}}

\label{sec:discussion}
Astrophysical tests of modified gravity theories rely on fifth force effects 
that act on unscreened  galaxies. They may constrain important regimes
of the parameter space that cannot be accessed with cosmological tests and
laboratory experiments in the foreseeable future. 
%In a few earlier
% papers \citep{cabre2012,jainvinu2012} we established techniques
%to classify galaxies into screened and unscreened categories and that 
%serves as
%the basis of this work. 
We have used published observational data on dwarf galaxies 
to perform three observational
tests of modified gravity. These are: offsets between the stellar and
gaseous components, warping of stellar disks, asymmetry in the gaseous rotation
curves. 




The offset study based on optical and HI centroids shows that it is not
possible to constrain gravity theories using the current HI data. 
The centroid of the gaseous
component is associated with a large 'unknown' error mostly due to the
limitations of current 21cm observations. Because of this we are unable to
model the background astrophysical offset which highly affect the statistical
attempt to find any difference between the screened and unscreened sample. 
However, with better data, both in quality and quantity, this can be used as a
powerful test of gravity.
%On the other hand, the gaseous centroid from the \ha~ rotation
%curve may be a good alternate to the HI based centroid estimate. However,
%the uncertainty on the screening level of \ha~ may be a potential source of
%systematics. 
As an alternative, we showed that the offset between giant
and main sequence stellar populations can be a potential test of gravity 
(though giant stars are only partially unscreened). 
We found that the current data involves several systematics and therefore lack
the potential to perform any gravity test. However, 
improvements can be made with high resolution panoramic observations of a
number of dwarf galaxies within about 10 Mpc. Our study show that the data is
consistent with both GR and modified gravity predictions within 2-$\sigma$
(1-$\sigma$) for $f_{R0}=1\times10^{-6}$($1\times10^{-7}$). The final study in
this series is the offset between optical and dynamical center. 
% The intrinsic noise in this
% probe is about 5\% which is in the same order of magnitude of 
% the signal due to modified gravity. Therefore, this probe is highly
% statistically competitive.
We found that this test can rule out any modified theories which predicts more
than 5\% offset relative to its optical radius with more than 3-$\sigma$
confidence and stands as the most powerful test of all the above. 

% A few hundred galaxies would allow us to do 
% competitive number. However, it is difficult to predict a theory for this
% test,but it should be the same order than the offset between HI and optical
% centroids studied before. The biggest assumption in this test is \ha~ being
% unscreened.

We measure the warp of the stellar disks of late type galaxies 
using SDSS images. We found that the warp within three half light radius of
the galaxies are consistent with both GR and modified theories. Also, we found
that the fraction of galaxies with U-type warp does not change with local
density/potential as expected in modified gravity theories. To get any strong
constraint out of this test we need $\sim$ 8000 and 20000 low mass galaxies
with reasonable estimates of halo parameters and a good measure of the external
 force (i.e. the parameters involved in the modeling of warp). i. e.,
currently, the largest uncertainty in this test is introduced by the model
parameters not by the data.

% The low S/N of SDSS images prevent us from
% measuring the warp at larger radius from the center of the galaxies where
% the signal will be stronger, if any. We expect that the surveys 
% like DES can improve in this regard. 

In the final test we estimated the asymmetry in the stellar \ha~ rotation
curves, which arises due to the stellar and gaseous offset, using the GHASP
sample. We found that the asymmetry attributable to modified gravity is as low
as $-0.001 \pm 0.012$ compared to the expected value of 0.1 (i.e, 10\%
asymmetry). This implies that the modified gravity models which predicts 10\%
asymmetry can be rule out at $5 \sigma$ level. However, this test carries two
major uncertainties, first from the data and second from the modeling due to
insufficient knowledge of halo parameters. The former can be systematic
uncertainties due to non-circular motions and asymmetric drift etc. 

Finally, we examined individual rotation curves from the GHASP 
galaxies and classified them based on the different signatures 
in the curves. We found that the majority of these galaxies 
have fairly symmetric curves irrespective
of their local density/potential. However, we identified a 
few galaxies with interesting features in the rotation curves.
 Some of these galaxies have other signatures of fifth force
 like U-type warps and optical offset from that of HI. 
These galaxies may require further studies to find whether 
these features are
due to fifth forces or astrophysical  processes.

\subsection{Caveat}
\label{sec:caveat}
All the tests we perform in this paper are based on statistical analysis of
screened and unscreened galaxies. As we noted in the previous sections the
modified gravity contribution to the unscreened sample is found by removing
other astrophysical effects determined from the screened sample. Therefore, one
of the biggest assumptions in our study is that the background astrophysical
effects on the unscreened sample is identical to the screened sample. However,
this could be a potential problem if the environment and mass range of
screened sample are significantly different from that of the unscreened sample.
In that case the environment and mass dependent astrophysical effects, if any,
will have significant impact on our method of background removal from the
unscreened sample. In many tests we minimize this problem by limiting our
screened samples to low mass galaxies. However, we recommend that the future
studies should use only the environmentally screened sample to determine the
background astrophysical effects.

Another important caveat is that we use a set of hetrogenous data to perform
the tests described above. However, these data are not meant to do gravity
test and therefore not useful to get tighter constraints for modified gravity
parameters. One of the fine examples is the test using HI and optical
centroids. The 'unknown' error in the HI centroid only allows us to predict
future requirements of HI precision and did not allow to make any constraints
from the current data. The test based on kinematical and optical centroids
 was able to predict good limits to observable parameters. The tests which
involve RGB centroid, warp measurements and asymmetry of \ha{} rotation curves
suffer several systematics and observational uncertainties. A homogenous data
set, specifically designed to test gravity which allow us to make all the above
measurements simultaneously, require to make tight constrains on gravity
parameters.

% 
% As we discussed in detail above, there are several unresolved 
% issues in this
% study. Some of them are due to the poor quality of data, 
% e.g. estimation of
% gaseous centroid from HI data, and others are due to the 
% lack of knowledge
% about the screening level, e.g. the assumption that \ha~ 
% traces stellar disk. 
% Currently, the warping study is not limited by the number
%  of galaxies but by 1.
% the ALFALFA survey as we classify galaxies into low and
%  high mass based on the
% mass estimate from ALFALFA 2. the low image quality of 
% SDSS to measure warp
% curve of faint dwarf galaxies.

% To improve on the latter, 
% the rotation of the stellar
% component can be best estimated by the observations of stellar absorption
% lines.
% However, this observation requires significant telescope time for dwarf
% galaxies. On the other hand, accurate measurements of these lines for a few
% dwarf galaxies and comparison with gaseous rotation curves would  in
% principle give a direct estimates of the effective gravitational constant. 

\vinusays{We have already discussed future prospects in some sections. Do we
need to repeat that here? For optical-HI and kinematical-optica centroids we
need to quote the required number of galaxies to get tight constraints.}
\subsection{Future prospects}
The main suggestions from this study are the following
\begin{enumerate}
%%follow the same items as in 3.1. Can use sub-items for the 3 types of offset
%tests. 
\item
Offset between HI and optical image:
It is crucial to improve the precision in HI measurements which is the main
the limiting factor of this study. Using the ALFALFA data, the
error in the offset estimate is $\sim$ 2 kpc and to get an error of 50 (10) pc
we need to stack $\sim 2\times10^{3}$ ($4\times10^{4}$) galaxies. The harder
part is to observe these many galaxies in HI. \vinusays{Jake: please add your conclusion based on the improvement of HI resolution}
\subitem
Offset between optical and dynamical center: \ha~ rotation curves of a few
hundred galaxies are sufficient to reduce the error of the mean to a
competitive number.
\subitem
Red giants displacement: Currently, the red giants test is mostly dominated
by systematics. As the signal in this test is weaker than the other probes, the
best approach would be to focus on a limited number of galaxies with a very
well known external force. The uncertainty in the external force is the
limiting factor if one wants to constrain modified gravity.

\item
Warping in edge-on galaxies: To reduce the observed error in the warp to
the level of uncertainty in the predicted values requires good quality images
of more than 8000 dwarf galaxies in very low density environments and 20000
dwarf galaxies in low to moderately dense environments for $f(R)$ theories with
$f_{R0} = 2\times10^{-7}$ and $f_{R0} = 1\times10^{-6}$. These numbers seem
feasible with the current and ongoing galaxy surveys. However, the
lack of accurate estimates of halo parameters lead to larger uncertainties
in the test. Use of optical scaling relations to estimate halo parameters
leave large uncertainties in the prediction of warp strength.

% \item
% Asymmetry in \ha~ velocity curve: This test allows us to rule out modified
% gravity theories that would produce a 10\% asymmetry with high confidence.
% The main assumption here is considering \ha~ a screened tracer. In addition,
% it is complicated to get theoretical prediction for asymmetry to constrain
% $\Delta G/G$.

\item
A direct estimation of  $\Delta G/G$ can be found by comparing \ha{} or HI
rotation curves with stellar rotation curve which is estimated by the
observations of stellar absorption lines. The rotation curve
measurements from absorbtion lines requires several hours in large telescope.
However, observations of a handful of unscreened galaxies can place stroger
constraints on modified gravity theories.

\section{Algorithm to find intrinsic dispersion}
\label{ap:avg}

In most of the probes that we consider in this paper, there is an intrinsic
dispersion associated with the estimated parameter due to astrophysical
systematic effects that can be
larger than the error in individual measurements.
Because we weight the data by the inverse variance while calculating the
mean value, including an intrinsic dispersion keeps data points 
with small measurement errors from being inappropriately over-weighted. It 
leads to an improved  estimate of the mean and the error in the mean value.
 Here we describe our approximate procedure to estimate the intrinsic
dispersion,  and the improved mean and the error in the mean.

%In most of the sections we have small number of galaxies. This population of
%galaxies may have some intrinsic dipersion in the paramters we try to measure
%(eg. offset beween stellar and gaseous components). For a large number of
%galaxies this intrisic dispersion may averaged out to zero. However, in the
%case of small number of galaxies intrisic property of the galaxies may
%contribute to average and contaminate the signal caused by fifth force. We
%estimate the intrisic dispersion and include when calculating average
%quantities as follows

We have set of N observed values $x_i$ and errors $\sigma_i$. We calculate the
weighted average as 
\begin{equation}
 \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_i{x_i w_i}}{\sum_i{w_i}}
\label{eq:weightavg}
\end{equation}
where $w_i = 1/\sigma_i^2$. Now, we add a constant systematic error $\sigma_s$
to all the
individual errors as $\sigma_{{\rm eff},i}^2 = \sigma_i^2 + \sigma_s^2$ which
accounts for the intrinsic dispersion. 
For a Gaussian random variable this satisfies:
\begin{equation}
 \sum_i{\frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{\sigma_{{\rm eff},i}^2}} = N
\end{equation}
Now we recalculate the mean $\bar{x}$ using Eq. \ref{eq:weightavg} with $w_i =
1/\sigma_{{\rm eff},i}^2$. This process continues until it converges. Finally, the
error on the average $\bar{x}$ will be calculated by
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{\bar{x}}^2 = \frac{1}{\sum_i{1 / \sigma_{{\rm eff},i}^2}}
\end{equation}


\section{Red giant stars}
\label{ap:color-mag}
In Fig \ref{fig:selectrg} we show an example of color-magnitude diagram to
illustrate the selection of red giant stars. 
\begin{figure}

and F814W. The red region shows the selected red giants, that reside at the tip
red-bright end. \label{fig:selectrg}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Systematic effects associated with offset between RGB and main
sequence stars}
\label{ap:rgb-systematics}
In this section we summarise the potential systematic errors related to test
based on red giant stars.
In Fig \ref{fig:rgsyst} we explore whether the observed displacement
is correlated with the distance to the galaxy as the fixed angular resolution
of the instrument may result larger error in the offset measurement of distant
galaxies. We plot this correlation in the left panel and see a small
correlation towards the expected direction. To check whether this affects
our conclusions, we divided the sample in different distance bins and
reanalysed them in individual bins. We found that our conclusions do not change
significantly even if we consider galaxies at similar distances.
On the right panel we plot the correlation between the
displacement and a measurement of asymmetry. The asymmetry is defined as the
difference in centroids of main sequence stars at two different isocontours of
stellar number density describing inner and outer part of
the galaxy. We see that red giant displacement is strongly correlated with
this asymmetry measurement, indicating that the effect may be related
to the internal structure of the galaxy. It should be noted that
similar asymmetry may occur in the presence of modified gravity as described
earlier. However, if we find the presence of similar effects in a screened
galaxy sample then we will able to separate the modified gravity effects from
internal structure of the galaxy. \jakesays{This could go the other
way as well: we expect more distortion (warps, etc) in unscreened galaxies,
so this correlation should exist in MG.  Should we mention this?}\vinusays{I
think you are right. I included the text FIXED } Also,
note that most of galaxies show a displacement (main sequence to red giant
centroid) that is lower than the galaxy asymmetry, dots above line y=x.
\jakesays{I'm not sure about this either: do we expect the scales to be
the same, or even linearly related?}\vinusays{The question is, to which
main sequence centroid we compare that of RGB?. If the centroids of the MS
change a lot with the different contour and if it is larger than the difference
between the centrpoids of RGB and MS then it is going to be a problem. CHECK}


We also checked if the displacement is related to the number of stars
(shot-noise), the ratio of red giants compared to the number of main sequence
stars,
the luminosity of the galaxy (indicative of mass and size),  the HI line
width (also indicator of mass), filters used to determine red giants or
magnitude limit in the whole sample which depends on the
camera used. None of these observables are correlated with the
displacement of red giants.






\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/dispdist.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/dispdispcm.png}
  \caption{We plot distance vs displacement in the left to study systematics
due to lower resolution once we go further away. On the right, we plot the
correlation between red giants displacement and degree of asymmetry of the
galaxy (the straight line shows y=x). Note how the asymmetry is bigger than
the displacement in almost all the cases, 
suggesting that the displacement is just a result of internal structure.}
\label{fig:rgsyst}
\end{figure*}

We examined the effect of differences in
the area that we used to calculate the centroid of main sequence stars and red
giants. Usually the galaxy is not well centered in the image, that is the
reason why we have to study systematics in the definition of 
the galaxy limiting area. Although it is easier to define isocontours in
number counts using all the stars, there are a lot of interlopers (faint stars)
that do not belong to the galaxy. We recalculated the centroid
after gradually removing the faintest stars. We include galaxies only if their
centroids converge after removing 20\% of faintest stars.
We also test if crowded regions can bias the result based on flags defined in
\citet{dalcanton09}. Due to longer exposure times, large number of faint
foreground star will be detected which leads to poor photometry of individual
stars. Moreover, we have calculated the centroid of main sequence stars
weighting by luminosity, and still the displacement of red giants is consistent.
Finally, we change our definition of red giants by going 0.5
magnitudes fainter, and we exclude bright stars from the definition of
main sequence stars, and conclusions remain the same. 


We also checked if the displacement is related to the number of stars
(shot-noise), the ratio of red giants compared to the number of main sequence
stars,
the luminosity of the galaxy (indicative of mass and size),  the HI line
width (also indicator of mass), filters used to determine red giants or
magnitude limit in the whole sample which depends on the
camera used. None of these observables are correlated with the
displacement of red giants.


\section{Warp}
\label{ap:warp}
In this section we describe the systematics effects related to warp results in
section \ref{sec:warp}. Also, we show that our results do not change even if we
use another estimator for warp. Finally, we show that the U-type galaxy
fraction does not depend on the environment. 

\subsection{Distance systematics}
\label{ap:distance-systematic}
A number of systematic effects may be involved in the warp analysis.
The first is bias related to distance.
In our sample there exists a strong correlation between
distance and average physical galaxy size:
this is due to the fact that it is difficult to observe physically
smaller galaxies at higher distance. If the measured warp depends on the
size of the galaxy, then the comparison between screened and unscreened
samples should be done as a function of distance to limit systematic effects
due to the different samples.
We check the distance bias by plotting the warp parameter against
distance to the galaxies. The left panel of figure \ref{warp-syst} shows that
the normalized warp parameter, $w_1$, is independent of the distance to
the galaxy, as expected.


On the other hand, the estimator $w_2$ does depend
on the size of the galaxy: two galaxies with identical $w_1$ curves
will differ in $w_2$,
depending on the size of the galaxy. Therefore, the
size-distance relation implies that the estimated values of $w_2$ will be
higher at larger distances. The right panel of figure \ref{warp-syst}
shows that this is indeed true. It should be noted that we have a
systematically higher fraction of screened galaxies at smaller distance. We
found that these galaxies belong to the Virgo cluster at distance $\sim 17$
Mpc. Therefore, when we consider all the galaxies irrespective of their size
the screened sample have a smaller average value of $w_2$ compared to that of
unscreened galaxies due to the large fraction of screened galaxies at smaller
distances. i.e. the marginal difference between $w_2$ distributions of screened
and unscreened samples can be explained by this effect (compare figure
\ref{fig:warp-distr} and figure \ref{warp-syst}). Another potential systematic
effect may be related to the inclination of the galaxy.  In Appendix
\ref{ap:inclination-systematic} we argue that inclination bias will not
affect our results.


\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.37]{figures/distance-vs-warpness.png}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.37]{figures/distance-vs-warp-kpc.png}
  \caption{Systematic effects involved in warp test. The left panel shows the
warp ($w_1$) vs distance (Eq. \ref{warp-param}), right panel shows
warp in kpc vs  distance (Eq. \ref{warp-param2}) for screened and
unscreened galaxies. If the screened sample is systematically
closer than unscreened galaxies, then we measure a lower value of warp for
screened sample compared to unscreened sample, which goes in the same direction
as the modified gravity prediction.}
\label{warp-syst}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Systematics due to inclination}
\label{ap:inclination-systematic}
The inclination could be a potential source of systematics in the analysis of
warp. The warp parameter can be estimated well for edge-on galaxies. On
the other
hand, the apparent warp may be nearly zero for warped face-on galaxies, and 
therefore its calculation is more difficult. This is the
source of systematics introduced by the inclination. If the unscreened galaxies
are systematically more inclined than the screened galaxies, then the warp
parameter estimation will be more robust (less error) for unscreened galaxies. 
We, therefore, check whether there is any systematic difference between the
distributions of axis ratio for screened and unscreened galaxies. Figure
\ref{warp-incl} shows the result. It can be seen that the axis ratio
of both screened and unscreened galaxies are distributed similarly. So we
conclude that if any systematics introduced by inclination may be affected
equally to screened and unscreened galaxies. It should be noted that we
correct the warp for the inclination and any remaining bias, if at all,
must be affecting the screened and unscreened galaxies equally.\\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/axis-ratio-dist.png}
\caption{Figure shows the distribution of axis ratio for screened and
unscreened galaxies with $f_{R0}=2\times10^{-7}$. No difference found between
the two samples.}
\label{warp-incl}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dependence of fraction of U-type warp galaxies on the screening
level}
An additional test we can perform with the data is to check whether there is
any noticeable difference in the fraction of galaxies with U-type warp in the
screened and unscreened sample. From the modified gravity prediction we expect
that the fraction of U-type galaxies is larger in the unscreened sample
compared to the screened sample. For this test we classify galaxies as U-type
warp by introducing an additional constraint on the value of the warp. We
classify a galaxy as warped only if the galaxy has more than 3\% warp, i.e. if
$w_1 > 0.03$. As we explained earlier, if the signs of left and right side warp
are different then we classify them as U-type. In Fig \ref{fig:warp-stren-frac}
we show the result. From the figure it can be seen that the fraction of U-type
warp do not depend on the screening level. This implies that physical process
which causes the formation of U-type warp works irrespective of the local
density of the galaxy. It should be noted that this result does not vary with
the choice of lower threshold value of the warp (i.e. $w_1 > 3$\%) to define
the U-warp. Further, in Appendix \ref{ap:warp-distri}, we show that the
fraction of normal, S-type galaxies are also same in screened and unscreened
regions.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{figures/warp-frac-vs-environ.png}
\caption{The fraction of U-type warped galaxies with environment. In this plot
we classify galaxy as U-type if the warp is greater than or equal to 3\%.

%define U-type warp.} 
}
%\textbf{The predictions from theory may be
%included here.}}
\label{fig:warp-stren-frac}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Distribution of warp}
\label{ap:warp-distri}
In Section \ref{sec:warp} we have shown that the distribution of
U-type warp does not depend on the the environment. However, we include
only U-type warp in that analysis. Here we check whether the conclusion in
 section \ref{sec:warp} still holds if we include all kind of
warp in the analysis. For this purpose we define the \textit{effective}
total warp ($w_e$) of galaxies as the absolute value of the difference
between the warp of left and right hand sides of the galaxy. As we
explained before the U-type galaxies will have opposite signs for left and 
right side waprnesses and S-type/N-type will have same signs for both sides.
Therefore, our definition of $w_e$ will leads to larger value for a symmetric
U-type warp and zero for other cases. However, the other type of warps can also
give smaller non-zero values for $w_e$ depending on the asymmetry of the warp
curve. The same applies to U-type warp where the $w_e$ can be smaller for weak
warp curves. We find that almost all galaxies, except U-type warps, have
$w_e < 0.1$ with warp definition Eq \ref{warp-param}. It is shown in the
left panel of figure \ref{warp-cumu-1}. Also, we found that the distribution of
$w_e$ does not have any dependence on the environment and it is shown in the
middle panel of figure \ref{warp-cumu-1}. We also found that there is no 
noticeable difference between the distributions of S-type warps in screened and
unscreened regions and it is shown in the right panel of the figure. We found
similar results if we use Eq \ref{warp-param2} to define
warp. In that case $w_e = 0.5$ kpc separate U-type warps from the rest. 

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.34]{figures/warpness-cumu-method1.png}

\caption{Left : The cumulative histrogram of $w_e$ (see text for the
definition). The U-type warps can be distinguished  with $w_e > 0.1$. Middle

$f_{R0}=2\times10^{-7}$. The right panel shows the distributions of S-type
warps in screened and unscreened regions with $f_{R0}=2\times10^{-7}$.}
\label{warp-cumu-1}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

In Figure \ref{fig:warp-stren-frac} we show the fraction of galaxies
with U-type warps in different environments. We check whether the fraction of
normal galaxies and fraction of S-type galaxies have any dependence on their
environment and the result is shown in figure \ref{warp-frac}. We classify
a galaxy as normal if the warp is less than 5\%.  We find that the
fractions of different types of galaxies is independent of their
environment. The result is insensitive to
the definition of normal galaxy.

 \caption{The fraction of normal, S-type and U-type galaxies in screened and

different types in screened and unscreened regions. The error in the plots are
calculated by assuming Poissonian noise on the number of galaxies.}

\caption{Summary of warp tests. The columns are: 1. {\bf Type:} the 
type of warp included in the analysis. All - included all galaxies, U - used
only U-type warps. 
2. $f_{R0}$ - the value of $f_{R0}$ parameter used to classify
screened and unscreened galaxies 
3. {\bf Number:} - $N_S$, $N_U$ are the number of
galaxies in screened and unscreened regions. 
4. $w_S$, $w_U$ are the average
value of the two  $w_1$ or $w_2$ in screened and unscreened galaxies 
5. $\hat{w}_{MG}$ - estimated warp due to modified gravity. 
6. {\bf Prediction:}  the theoretical predictions for  unscreened galaxies 
with $\Delta G/G=1/3$
and $\Delta G/G=1$.
The upper part of the table is for the dimensionless warp parameter $w_1$ 
(defined in Eqn. \ref{warp-param}) and lower part is for the parameter $w_2$
(defined in Eqn. \ref{warp-param2}). In the second part of the table we group
U-type galaxies based on their half light radius ($h_r$) to compare the
warp. See text for details. The estimated value of $\hat{w}_{MG}$ is
consistent with GR in all cases, but the error bars are too large to detect the
MG predictions shown in the last column.

\section{Examples of interesting observations}
\label{ap:curves}
We present some examples of optical images (Figs \ref{fig:eg-image-1} \&
\ref{fig:eg-image-2}) and rotation curves (Figs \ref{fig:GHASPsym} \&
\ref{fig:GHASPasym}) of unscreened galaxies from the literature which look
interesting under modified gravity scenario.

unscreened for $f_{R0}=10^{-6}$. The galaxy is asymmetric in optical. The \ha~
rotation curve also shows strong asymmetry. 
{\it Right panel:} Comparison of HI and optical images of UGC 4325. The HI
image shows some asymmetry. However, this does not have any neighbors near. See
text for more details. The images are taken from \citet{figgs2008,swaters2002b}

\caption{Examples of \ha~ symmetric rotation curves for GHASP galaxies.  x
coordinates show main axis in kpc, y coordinates show velocity in km/s before 
correcting for inclination. The
left side points of the rotation curves are shown as red points for comparison 
to the right side. We indicate the
name of the galaxy, also $\Delta v$ defined in the text and the
potential created by clusters and galaxies within 3 Mpc. 
The potential is written 
in red if the galaxy is unscreened, 
and black if it is environmentally screened, for $f_{R0}=10^{-6}$. 
We label the inclination and the averaged maximum velocity of the galaxy
once corrected for inclination.
Diamonds show HI curves, when available. Blue vertical lines show the range 
used to calculate $\Delta v$, based on half-light radius. Note how UGC 4325
shows a difference between HI and \ha~, 
in the direction predicted by modified gravity, HI $> H\alpha$
