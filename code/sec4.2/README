In table 1 of the draft, Anna gives limits for six different samples. ie.
for fR0 = 1e-7, 1e-6.5, 1e-7 with galaxies of vmax < 200 km/s and no
constraints on vmax. So I generate six subsamples according to her sample
selection. The first column in the attached files is the ratio of offset to
the optical radius, second column gives its error and the third column tells
the screening level of that galaxy (0/1 for unscreened/screened galaxy). The
file name of each file tells the corresponding subsample.
Let me know if you have any question
